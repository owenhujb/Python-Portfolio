    "After running the above code to take a deeper dive into the various categories on Google Play, a few niche categories stand out. For example, the Shopping category, although still featuring a few big companies, is composed of many more smaller apps that still manage to gain significant traction. Many of these apps appear to also employ elements popular to the Google Play store; for example, the apps \"Tophatter - 90 Second Auctions\" and \"Shopfully - Weekly Ads & Deals\" both have over ten million downloads and take advantage of gamification by making online shopping more fun, feeding into the Google Play store's second-most common category of gaming.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, I make a similar recommendation for the Google Play store as made for the App Store: the Shopping category has niche apps without being overly saturated by giants, and building on the emerging theme of gamification found in some apps in this category has potential for a new app to gain a lot of traction and generate a lot of installations, thus leading to high ad revenue and profitability."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzed what the most popular genres and categories of apps are in both the App Store and Google Play store to aid any companies aiming to develop ad revenue-based apps in the free English markets. The analysis examined the general sentiment of what types of apps are common in each market, finding that both stores had high prevalences of fun and entertaining apps (the App Store moreso), before taking a deeper look at rating counts, ratings, and installation numbers for specific genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "With all the above data, I arrive at a final recommendation for a developer or company to break into the **Shopping category**, which I believe holds the most potential. Although plenty of categories such as Finance, Books, and Weather appear suitable for entry, Shopping particularly stood out in being one where there are emerging developers taking advantage of the preference for gamification in apps. In both markets, Shopping is not dominated by a few large corporate giants but instead features plenty of successful apps from smaller developers. Moreover, consistent with both markets, the category is not overly saturated; in fact, the average rating of the Shopping genre is above the average for all genres, raising the possibility of additional revenue sources with in-app purchases or subscriptions should customers be satisfied enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make a new app stand out in this category, I encourage any companies to consider potentially implementing elements of gamification, such as initiating an online shopping challenge or allowing users to share with friends their newly bought items in a fun way. This is supported by the fact that both markets, especially the App Store, have a high prevalance and demand for fun and entertaining apps. Overall, my data-backed recommendation will allow developers to make the most profitable apps with their target audience."
