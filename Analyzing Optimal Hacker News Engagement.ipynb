    "# Optimizing Engagement Opportunities for Posts on the Hacker News Community\n",
    "\n",
    "The following project analyzes data from Hacker News posts between September 2015 and September 2016. Hacker News is a technology and entrepreneurship discussion forum for enthusiasts of various interests run by Y Combinator, a startup incubator.\n",
    "\n",
    "My analysis aims to answer two essential questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which of `Ask HN` or `Show HN` posts gain more comments tranction or points traction on the discussion forum? \n",
    "2. What is the optimal time to post to gain the most comments or points for a post?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `Ask HN` posts are posts when users ask the community a question, such as for feedback, technical help, or opinions. `Show HN` posts are those that show the Hacker News community anything the user has made or found interesting, such as a project. As such, finding data on what time of day is optimal to make a post will help any Hacker News users maximize the chance their `Ask HN` or `Show HN` post gains the most responses to their questions or points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because this project works by analyzing the number of comments, the original dataset, which may be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts), was reduced to around 20,000 rows of post data by removing any posts that did not have comments and randomly filtering the rest to this [dataset](https://dq-content.s3.amazonaws.com/356/hacker_news.csv).\n",
    "\n",
    "I begin by importing in the modified dataset and removing the header."

After determining that ask posts tended to average more comments and show posts tended to average more points, I determined the top 5 hours for which ask posts averaged the most comments and for which show posts averaged the most points.\n",

For Hacker News users who want to maximize the engagement on their posts, posting during these times will optimize the likelihood of getting the answers they need or the community responses they want."
