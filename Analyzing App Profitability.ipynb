    "After running the above code to take a deeper dive into the various categories on Google Play, a few niche categories stand out. For example, the Shopping category, although still featuring a few big companies, is composed of many more smaller apps that still manage to gain significant traction. Many of these apps appear to also employ elements popular to the Google Play store; for example, the apps \"Tophatter - 90 Second Auctions\" and \"Shopfully - Weekly Ads & Deals\" both have over ten million downloads and seem to take advantage of gamification by making online shopping more fun, feeding into the Google Play store's second most common category of gaming. As such, a similar recommendation can be made for developing apps in this category to be profitable as made for the App Store: the shopping category has niche apps without being overly saturated by giants, and building on the emerging theme of gamification found in some apps in this category has potential for an app to gain a lot of traction."

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This project analyzed what the most popular genres and categories of apps are in both the App Store and Google Play store to aid any companies aiming to develop ad-based apps in the free and English markets. The analysis examined the general sentiment of what types of apps are common in each market, finding that both stores had high prevalences of fun and entertaining apps (the App Store especially), before taking a deeper look at rating counts and installation numbers for specific genres.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although plenty of categories such as books, finance, and weather appear to be suitable for entry, the shopping category particularly stood out in being one where there are emerging developers taking advantage of the preference for gamification in apps. In both markets, the shopping category is not dominated by a large corporate giants but instead feature plenty of successful apps from smaller developers. To make a new app stand out in this category, I encourage any companies to consider potentially implementing elements of gamification, such as initiating an online shoppping challenge or allowing users to share with friends their newly bought items. This data-backed conclusion will allow developers to make the most profitable apps with their target audience."
